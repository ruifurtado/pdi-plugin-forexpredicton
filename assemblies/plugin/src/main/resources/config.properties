# This config file is divided in two parts. 
# The first parameters refer to the technical analysis features used to fill the provided datasets
# The second part refers to hyperparameters used by each created RF model
# The specified parameters are going to be the same for each provided csv/model
# It is not needed to specify the two types of parameters. However, when one starts to specify a parameter of this type, all the other ones of that type need to be specified

# Technical analysis parameters

# These are the default parameters for each Technical Indicator
# Each parameter corresponds to the number of days that each parameter considers in its calculation
# The bigger the length of each one of these parameters, the greater is the lag displayed by it
# Small lengths are good for short term trading because they have the capacity to identify trends faster
# Bigger lengths are more suited for long term investors 
# The default values are typical applied short values

# MOVING AVERAGES
# Typical values for moving averages are 10, 20, 50, 100 , 200 

# Number of days considered by a simple moving average
SMAdays=50

# Number of days considered by an exponential moving average. It is similar to a simple moving average, except that more weight is given to the latest data.
EMAdays=20

# Number of days considered by a weighted moving average. It is quite similar to the exponential, but the weighted applied to more recent prices is not exponential.
# As we go back in time, the rate decreases consistently instead of exponentially. 
WMAdays=100

# The Momentum Technical Indicator measures the change of price of a financial instrument over a given time span.
MOMdays=20

# Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices.
# The typical values used in this one are 12 for the fast period moving average and 9 for the slow period moving average
# A 9 EMA of the MACD, called the "signal line", is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell signals.
MACDfastPeriod=12
MACDslowPeriod=26
MACDdays=9

# Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between 0 and 100.
# RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.
# The typical value for RSI is 14 days 
RSIdays=14

# RF model hyperparameters

# Number of trees used in the model. By increase this parameter, we are creating more single decision trees to be used in the tree ensemble, 
# thus reducing  variance in predictions. 
numTrees=10

# Maximum depth of each tree in the forest. This parameter controls the maximum possible depth that each single decision tree could have. 
# Deeper trees reduce the available bias in predictions.
maxDepth=5
